            <br/>
            Better known as PD.
            <br/>
            A round peg that fits many holes.
            <br/>
            Worked as a strategist and as a hybrid art and copy creative.
            <br/>
            His flexible workstyle has won the praise of many people.
            <br/>
            People such as his own mother.
            <br/>
            He was once worried that texting LOL without laughing was insincere.
            <br/>
            So he now types HAAHAHAH in complete silence.
            <br/>
            He believes that imagination and problem solving are the greatest gifts to mankind...
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Let's not put them to waste.
