            Grab partnered with Disney for the launch of Frozen 2 in Southeast Asia. Inspired by the theme of the movie, we created a campaign to encourage parents to let their children live their dreams, no matter what they may be.
        </p>
        <ul class="imagelist">
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Aside from the film that you see above, we also made little changes within the Grab app. During the campaign period, the app and vehicles were given a Frozen themed skin. We also added a challenge mechanic that rewarded users with movie tickets upon completion.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also had a small microsite for users to find more in-depth information. This site also featured the half-and-half key visual.
        </p>

            Most of the visuals in this campaign were handled by me, with additional support from Mark Ng and Zara Kok. I also helped write some of the scripts, including the following one that the team was very excited for, but was not produced. This is how it looks after my creative director, Daniel Ko, had cleaned it up.
