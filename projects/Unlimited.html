        <h2>Unlimited Posters</h2>
        <p>For some businesses, filling in certain critical positions can be challenging. And sometimes, it’s not about finding the person with the right qualifications, but someone with the right attitude.</p>
        <p>At UOB, they met their staffing challenge at the UOB ScanHub, a facility that digitises millions documents a year. Faced with a high turnover rate, they found their solution when they reached out to a group of forgotten candidates — people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Wanting to share their success and encourage other businesses to think differently, UOB launched a campaign targeted at CEOs of businesses, big and small. We created a set of gift posters to accompany the campaign. These posters were inspired by the real achievements accomplished by people with disabilities.</p>
