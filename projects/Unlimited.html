        <h2>Unlimited Posters</h2>
        <p>For some businesses, filling certain critical positions can be a challenge. Some of these positions isn’t just about finding a person with the right qualifications, but someone with the right attitude.</p>
        <p>At UOB Scanhub, they needed someone who could take on the task of digitising documents over and over again. Where most people would turn tail to the monotony of the job, they found the solution by reaching out to a group of often forgotten talents — people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Today, not only has UOB overcome their issues with high turnover, they now digitise millions of documents a year. Encouraged by their success, UOB launched a campaign targeting CEOs of business, big and small, to think outside the box for their staffing needs. These set of posters were created based on real life success stories, printed as gifts to accompany the campaign.</p>

              <h4>For most, it's hard to see scanning hundreds of documents a day as a career that's taking off.
              </br>But not for the employees with disabilities at UOB Scan Hub. Today, they scan and digitise over 5 million documents a year.
            </br>Just imagine what people with disabilities could do for your business.
