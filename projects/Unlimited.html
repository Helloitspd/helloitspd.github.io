      <h2>Unlimited Posters</h2>
      <p>For some businesses, filling certain critical positions can be a challenge. Some of these positions aren’t just
        about finding a person with the right qualifications, but someone with the right attitude.</p>
      <p>At UOB Scanhub, they needed someone who could take on the task of digitising documents over and over again. But
        the job saw high turnovers, with many unable to take on its monotonous nature. To solve this, UOB reached out to
        an often forgotten group of talents — people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>Not only have they helped overcome the high turnover rates, but they also efficiently digitise millions of
        documents every year. Encouraged by their success, UOB launched a campaign to encourage more CEOs to think
        outside the box for their staffing needs. Featuring other real-life stories of other businesses, this set of
        gift posters was created to accompany the campaign.</p>

        <h4>For most, it's hard to see scanning hundreds of documents a day as a career that's taking off.
          </br>But not for the employees with disabilities at UOB Scan Hub. Today, they scan and digitise over 5 million
          documents a year.
          </br>Just imagine what people with disabilities could do for your business.

          Michelin-starred dishes flawlessly every night.
