        <h2>Diabetes: A Living Hell</h2>
        <p>The war against diabetes in Singapore has been ongoing for many years. But despite numerous efforts to curb the disease, the number of cases remains on the rise. In my research, many campaigns have adopted a blanket strategy, with messaging meant for everyone, young or old. As a result, the impact was lessened, with many younger Singaporeans only feeling the need to be concerned in their later years.</p>
        <p>Yet, Type 2 diabetes is a result of the ongoing lifestyle choices one makes from young. How much you eat and exercise today, affects your chance with diabetes tomorrow. With that in mind, I set out on creating a campaign that targeted the younger generation.</p>
        <p>From the depictions of hell at Haw Par Villa, I was inspired by the ways values have been instilled in Singaporeans since young through tales and religion. This resulted in a campaign that juxtaposed the suffering of hell and the disease.</p>
