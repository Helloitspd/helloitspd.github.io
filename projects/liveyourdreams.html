        <h2>Live Your Dreams</h2>
        <p>
          Christmas was set to get bigger and better with the biggest movie release that year, Disney’s Frozen 2. To make things even cooler, Grab has partnered up with Disney to bring a little magic to children all across Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, we drew inspiration from the movie, making a short film to encourage parents to let their children live their dreams, no matter what they may be. Coupled with an assortment of Frozen 2 prizes and giveaways, Grab users and their families could kick start their Frozen 2 adventures from the movie themed app. </p>

        <p>
          During the process, we had a script that the team really felt for. Here's how it goes:
        </p>
        <!--
            Most of the visuals in this campaign were handled by me, with additional support from Mark Ng and Zara Kok. I also helped write some of the scripts, including the following one that the team felt for, but was not produced. This is how it looks after my creative director, Daniel Ko, had cleaned it up.
        -->
        <button onclick="viewScript()" id="viewscript">View Script</button>
        <div id="script"><p>Our film opens on our hero boy, all excited as he looks up at a school notice board with
          the list of cast for a school play. Amongst the different Frozen-inspired roles, he sees
          that he’s going to be a Tree No. 4, and his face drops in disappointment.<p>
        <p>We cut to a practice for the Frozen-inspired school play, on a group of four kids
          dressed as trees at the back of a stage. As his friends sway in sync, our hero boy
          stands completely still, distracted by something in the distance. From a different angle,
          we reveal that he’s mesmerised and transfixed on the lead girl in a light blue
          Frozen-inspired dress.</p>
        <p>
          Over the next few days, we see our hero boy in his tree costume, now incredibly
determined and eager to get to practice – from hurrying his mother as she pays with
GrabPay at a store; to rushing into the school hall with his Frozen backpack, sandwich
in mouth and GrabFood bag in arms; to hurrying his father into a GrabCar ride to
practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the backseat of the GrabCar, we see our hero boy engrossed on his phone as he
watches the Frozen II trailer for the millionth time. We zoom into the boy’s phone, on
the trailer – full-screen. The trailer’s edit ends on a distinctive scene of Elsa, and we
match cut to our lead girl, striking a similar pose at practice. As before, we see our
hero boy standing shyly in the background, mesmerised by the lead girl as he mouths
along to her every line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we come to the day of the play. We see Mum and Dad taking their seats in the
school hall along with other parents, before the play starts. The curtains draw open,
and the children quickly get into their positions on stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lights dim, and a spotlight shines on the lead girl as she steps up to the front of
stage. But seeing the crowd before her, she is suddenly overwhelmed with stage fright
and unable to begin the opening song. As she stands frozen with anxiety, the kids look
at one another with worry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then to everyone’s surprise, a little voice starts singing. It’s our hero boy, plucking up
his courage to sing the opening song instead. The lead girl turns around and notices
him for the first time, visibly touched by his intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          But… our hero boy doesn’t even notice her now – unexpectedly, he unzips his tree
costume to reveal a heroic light blue suit underneath. His little voice becomes bold
and loud, as he bravely steps forward into the spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cut to Mum and Dad in the crowd, shocked at this unexpected turn of events.
But Mum quickly melts with pride, and nudges her still-surprised husband in her
excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We end on Mum and Dad’s point of view – as the camera slowly pulls in towards
our hero centrestage, and owning the lead role.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          In a reprise, we see the audience applauding at the end of the play. Mum and Dad
are on their feet with a dramatic, emotional Dad shedding tears of pride. Our hero
boy graciously calls out to the lead girl to share the applause, and together, they
take a bow.
